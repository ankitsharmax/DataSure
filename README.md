# DataSure

DataSure is a data validation project designed to ensure data quality before ingestion into databases.  

It works by validating Excel or CSV files against a predefined workflow that specifies expected columns and data types. The project evaluates each file to classify records as valid or invalid, and generates reports to help users identify and fix data issues before uploading.

## Why DataSure?

Often, CSV or Excel files downloaded from external or third-party portals are manually uploaded to databases without proper validation. This process can lead to data discrepancies and inaccuracies, impacting downstream systems and analytics.

DataSure addresses this by enforcing data validation rules to ensure that only data conforming to specified requirements is ingested, improving data accuracy and reliability.
